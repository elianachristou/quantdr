## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have:

* Removed the \dontrun{} example fron the llqr.R file.

* Reset to user's par() after I used par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) in the vignette.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies

* There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
