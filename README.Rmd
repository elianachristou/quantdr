# quantdr: Dimension Reduction for Conditional Quantiles

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The R package 'quantdr' performs dimension reduction techniques for conditional quantiles by estimating the fewest linear combinations of X that contain all the information on that function.  For details of the methodology, see [Christou, E. (2020) Central quantile subspace. *Statistics and Computing*, 30, 677â€“695](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-019-09915-8).

The main function of the package is 'cqs', which estimates the directions of the central quantile subspace.  Once the directions are determined, one can form the new sufficient predictors and estimate the conditional quantile function using the 'llqr' function of the package.  

## Installation

<!--  You can install the released version of quantdr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("quantdr") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

You can install the development version of quantdr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elianachristou/quantdr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve the problem. 

```{r example}
library(quantdr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
